          Hello. You are recieving this message because, to be frank, your website sucks. It's extremely hard to navigate, and it takes forever to figure out how to get to a certain page. It is also very vulnerable, as I have demonstrated by hacking your site. Don't worry, as I did not delete your code. I simply made this the default index page. It will stay that way until this issue is fixed. Yes, I am a student. Who? You may never know...
